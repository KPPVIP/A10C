Instructions [Add-On]:

1. Place the "stryker" folder into [Gamefolder]\update\X64\dlcpacks\

2. With OpenIV, extract [Game folder]\update\update.rpf\common\data\dlclist.xml and edit this with Notepad++. Add the following entry:
		<Item>dlcpacks:\a10c\</Item>

Vehicle spawn name:
a10c



Tuning options:
Spoiler -> cockpit mirrors
Chassis -> Change bomb to AGM-65


If you're game crashes on startup, download a custom gameconfig.xml for your update.rpf. Example: https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/gta-5-gameconfig-300-cars

I would advise using a Mods folder (more info at OpenIV) 
and make a backup, I take no responsibility if any shit happens.
